AutoRecorder.py will wait for a loudness threshold
then record five seconds of audio
then delete any files older than one hour (3600s)
then save the new file

this means there should always be one file left in the folder

files are saved at 'sensing/Audio/Autorecorder/records', so run from a folder above this or change this folder
