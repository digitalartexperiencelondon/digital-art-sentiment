# Shaders

The frontend of our application is built in JavaScript, as a [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) project. The p5.js application uses a WEBGL renderer, that allows us to code GLSL shaders in order to create our visuals.

# Get the App Up and Running

Note: The current code runs locally, and renders randomly generated test data. Connecting the frontend to the backend server is to be done soon.

## Requirements

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [p5-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=samplavigne.p5-vscode) extension for VSCode

## Installation

The easiest way to set the app up and running, is by installing [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and the [p5-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=samplavigne.p5-vscode) extension. This setup offers an easy way to generate and modify p5.js projects, as well as a live server to run the application.

## Usage

Open the `shaders` folder in VSCode, and run the live server by clicking the "Go Live" button in the bottom bar of VSCode (see the [p5-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=samplavigne.p5-vscode) specifications for details and further options). A browser will open automatically with the artwork visualization.
